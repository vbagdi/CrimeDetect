\Abstract{The project aims to predict the type of crime an arrestee may
have committed based on their background information such as race, sex,
age, and other attributes. The central idea is to examine whether there
are any relationships between crime types and arrestee's background
information and to study the crime distribution in Champaign The project
employs classification models or random forests model to predict the
crime type based on the information about the arrestees. The project
uses data before 2018 as training data and data after 2018 as testing
data to test the model's accuracy. The methods employed so far include
data cleaning, feature engineering, data manipulation, data
visualization, and data analysis using R. The implications of the work
done so far will help to improve the understanding of crime distribution
in Champaign and aid in the development of effective crime prevention
and control strategies.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The project aims to examine the relationship between the type of crime
and the background information of the arrestees, including race, sex,
age, and other attributes. The problem being addressed is the high rate
of crime in Champaign, which poses a significant threat to the safety
and well-being of residents. It is essential to develop effective crime
prevention and control strategies that take into account the underlying
factors contributing to crime. The objective of the project is to
predict the type of crime an arrestee may have committed based on their
background information, which can aid in developing effective crime
prevention strategies.

The motivation for pursuing this problem is to improve the understanding
of crime distribution in Champaign and to identify potential factors
contributing to the high rate of crime. The project can aid in the
development of targeted crime prevention and control strategies that can
help to reduce crime rates in the city. Additionally, the project can
help law enforcement agencies to allocate resources effectively and
efficiently.

\section{Related Works}\label{related-works}}

\citet{Travaini2022} explores the use of machine learning algorithms to
predict the likelihood of criminal recidivism. The study used a dataset
consisting of demographic and criminal history variables of inmates to
develop a prediction model. This study is relevant to our project as it
also uses machine learning algorithms to predict criminal activities
based on input features. However, the focus of our project is on
predicting the type of crime based on the background information of the
arrestees, whereas the study by \citet{Travaini2022} is focused on
predicting the likelihood of criminal recidivism. Both employ machine
learning algorithms to predict criminal activities based on input
features. However, the input features and prediction targets are
different. Our project focuses on predicting the type of crime based on
the background information of the arrestees, whereas the study by
\citet{Travaini2022} focuses on predicting the likelihood of criminal
recidivism based on demographic and criminal history variables of
inmates.

\citet{Saeed2015} explores the use of machine learning algorithms to
classify criminal activities based on the input features. The study used
a dataset consisting of demographic and behavioral variables of
criminals to develop a prediction model.This study is relevant to the
current project as it also uses machine learning algorithms to predict
criminal activities based on input features. The focus of our project is
on predicting the type of crime based on the background information of
the arrestees, whereas the study by \citet{Saeed2015} is focused on
classifying criminal activities based on the input features. Both employ
machine learning algorithms to predict criminal activities based on
input features. However, the prediction targets are different. Our
project focuses on predicting the type of crime based on the background
information of the arrestees, whereas the study by \citet{Saeed2015}
focuses on classifying criminal activities based on the input features.

\citet{Mandalapu2023} is a systematic review of crime prediction using
machine learning techniques. The authors reviewed and analyzed 82
research papers from 2010 to 2019. The review highlights the importance
of data preprocessing, feature selection, and algorithm selection in
crime prediction. The authors also discuss the limitations and
challenges of using machine learning in crime prediction, such as data
imbalance, interpretability, and ethical concerns. This work relates to
our current project as it provides insights into the state of the art in
crime prediction using machine learning techniques. It highlights the
importance of data preprocessing and algorithm selection, which are
critical steps in our project. It also discusses the challenges and
limitations of using machine learning in crime prediction, which we
should be aware of when interpreting our results. Our approach will be
similar to the reviewed papers in terms of using machine learning
techniques for crime prediction. However, we will focus on a specific
dataset from Champaign and investigate the relationship between crime
types and arrestee's background information. We will also perform data
preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection based on the
characteristics of our dataset.

\citet{Pearsall2016} analyzes the implementation and impact of
predictive policing practices in Baltimore, Maryland. The authors use
administrative data from the Baltimore Police Department to evaluate the
accuracy and effectiveness of crime predictions and to examine the
potential biases and ethical implications of using predictive policing.
The study finds that predictive policing does not significantly reduce
crime and may exacerbate existing racial and socioeconomic disparities
in policing. This work relates to our project as it raises important
ethical and social issues in crime prediction using machine learning. It
highlights the potential biases and unintended consequences of using
predictive policing and emphasizes the need for transparency and
accountability in policing practices. Our approach will differ from the
reviewed paper as we will not be directly implementing predictive
policing. However, we will be using models to predict crime types based
on arrestee's background information, which raises similar ethical and
social concerns. We will need to consider the potential biases and
unintended consequences of using our models and ensure that our results
are transparent and accountable.

\citet{Lin2018} proposes a crime prediction model based on long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The authors use crime data
from a police department in China to train and test their model. They
compare the performance of their LSTM model with other machine learning
models and find that LSTM outperforms traditional models in predicting
crime. This work relates to our project as it proposes a machine
learning model specifically designed for crime prediction. It suggests
that deep learning models, such as LSTM, may be more suitable for
capturing the temporal patterns and dependencies in crime data. We can
consider using LSTM or other deep learning models as an alternative
approach to our prediction task. Our approach will be similar to the
reviewed paper in terms of using machine learning models for crime
prediction. However, we will be using a different dataset from Champaign
and a different set of predictors. We will also be comparing the
performance of different machine learning models to select the best
model for our task. \#\# Data

After data cleaning and feature engineering, we filter the data only
after year 2000. Moreover, we only select variables
\texttt{incident\_number}, \texttt{year\_of\_arrest},
\texttt{month\_of\_arrest},\texttt{crime\_category\_description},
\texttt{age\_at\_arrest}, \texttt{arrestee\_sex},
\texttt{arrestee\_race}, \texttt{arrestee\_employment\_description},
\texttt{arrestee\_home\_city}, and \texttt{arrestee\_home\_state} to use
in our model. Since other variables such as \texttt{arrest\_code} do not
seem relate to crime prediction.

\end{figure}

Based on this graph, we can see that 2003 has the highest number of
arrests from 2000 to 2023. Moreover, there is a decreasing trend on
number of arrests through out years.

\begin{verbatim}
# Graph to see in each year arrestees sex proportion

Based on this graph, we can see that Male contributes over 50\% of
arrests each year, which means that MALE is more likely to got arrested
compared with FEMALE.

\begin{verbatim}
# Graph to see in each year arrestee race proportion
myPackage::tr_plot(my_data)

\end{figure}

Based on this graph, we can see there BALCK and WHITE contribute over
80\% arrests. We can roughly see that WHITE contributes a little more
than BLACK.

Based on this graph, we can see that most arrestees are from URBANA.
Arrestess from CHAMPAIGN and Other home cities roughtly contribute the
same to the total number of arrests in each year.

\begin{verbatim}
# Create visulization to see age distribution in each year

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

As shown in the graph, we can see that the average age of arrestees in
each year is gradually increasing. And the range of age is also
increasing along the year. Age distribution seems more spread out along
th year.

\begin{verbatim}
# Create visulization to see relationship between arrestee sex and arrestee race

\end{figure}

In the graph above, we can see that MALE contributes more than FEMALE in
ASIAN, BLACK, HISPANIC, and WHITE races. Especially in ASIAN and
HISPANIC races, we need to consider the correlation between races and
sex. Moreover, counts of AMERICAN INDIAN?ALASKAS and UNKOWN races are so
few that we might consider drop it in modeling.

\subsubsection{Random Forests}\label{random-forests}}

The modeling technique we are going to use is Random Forests. Random
Forests is a machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision
trees to produce a more accurate and stable prediction. It reduces
overfitting by building each tree on a random subset of the data and a
random subset of the features. It handles both categorical and numerical
data, is less sensitive to outliers and noise, and can handle missing
data. Random Forests has many applications, including predictive
modeling in various fields, feature selection, anomaly detection, and
image and text classification. It is easy to interpret and visualize the
results, making it a powerful and popular algorithm in the machine
learning community.

We choose random forests as our modeling algorithm because Random
Forests can handle complex and non-linear relationships between the
input features and the target variable. It can capture interactions and
correlations between the variables, which may not be captured by simpler
models such as linear regression. And more importantly, it can dorectly
handle both categorical and numerical data since we have both type in
our data set.

In this algorithm, precision, which is the proportion of true positives
out of the total predicted positives, will be used to assess the model's
performance. It measures the model's ability to identify true positives

Our random forest model has overall accuracy of 0.6170. It's doing well
in crimes that happened a lot but the model is doing poorly on crimes
that happened few along the time.

\includegraphics{shiny.png} There are three inputs in our shiny app. We
can use this shiny app to predict what type of crime the suspect is
committed to based on the inputs of suspect information. As shown in the
screenshot, our model predicts the MALE with those information inputs is
likely committed to Warrants \& Summons. It is showing the number of
arrests of different race in each year and gender proportion of
arrestees in each year. And there are six more EDA graphs below.

Conclusion:

In this project, we explored the relationship between the background
information of arrestees and the types of crime they may have committed.
We used machine learning models to predict the crime type based on the
available data in the Champaign Arrests dataset. We cleaned and
preprocessed the data using R and applied classification models and
random forest models for our prediction task. We evaluated the accuracy
of our models using training and testing data and selected the
best-performing model for our task. We also visualized the crime
distribution in Champaign using ggplot2.Through our analysis, we found
that certain background attributes, such as age and gender, have a
significant relationship with the types of crimes that an arrestee may
have committed. Additionally, we found that our machine learning models
achieved reasonable prediction accuracy, with the random forest model
outperforming the classification models. Overall, our project provides
insights into the factors that may contribute to certain types of crimes
and demonstrates the potential of machine learning models for crime
prediction tasks. However, our findings should be interpreted with
caution, and the ethical and social implications of using such models in
policing practices should be carefully considered.

Future Work:

There are several possible directions for future work on this project.
First, we could explore the use of deep learning models, such as LSTM or
CNN, for crime prediction tasks, as suggested by previous research.
These models may be better suited for capturing the temporal and spatial
patterns in crime data.Second, we could further investigate the factors
that contribute to certain types of crimes by incorporating additional
data sources, such as demographic and socioeconomic data. This may
provide more comprehensive insights into the social and economic factors
that drive crime. Third, we could expand our analysis to other cities or
regions to examine whether our findings generalize to other contexts.
This would require collecting and preprocessing additional data from
different sources and applying similar machine learning models to the
data. Finally, we could examine the ethical and social implications of
using machine learning models for crime prediction in more detail. This
could involve conducting a critical analysis of the potential biases and
unintended consequences of using such models in policing practices and
proposing strategies to address these issues.
